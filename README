README for WebCache::ICP
by Martin Hamilton <martinh@gnu.org>

This Perl module tries to implement the Internet Cache Protocol (ICP), as
specified in RFCs 2186 and 2187 - included here in the 'doc' subdirectory
of the module distribution.

If you downloaded this package from CPAN or a CPAN mirror site, you may
want to check back to its home page to see if there's a newer version:
<URL:http://wwwcache.ja.net/dev/perlmod/>


You install the module by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

Please report any bugs/suggestions to the author at the above address.


Two sample scripts and associated config files are included in the
'scripts' subdirectory.  These are:

  jellyfish.pl - a fake ICP server which can be used to selectively
                   report hits for those URLs you have mirrored.

  starfish.pl -  a Squid redirector which, on being given one of the
                   possible URLs for a widely replicated resource,
                   rewrites this to the URL of your local mirror copy.

Together these programs let you integrate a mirror server into a WWW
caching hierarchy, by making the mirror server appear to be a cache
server which already knows about the contents of the mirrored sites -
and all of the sites which mirror them.  See the file 'scripts/README'
for more information.
